# MyKVServer
a simple kv server by Rust and is under development

# Function
- baseed on grpc-rs by PingCAP
- support insert, get, delete and scan API currently
- I want to impl a skiplist but soon I realize that impl a linklist based skiplist with Rust is not simple
- persistent is not implemented yet -_-b
